	a lv2:Plugin ;
	lv2:binary <sine.dylib> ;
  staticLoader:symbolPrefix "methcla_lv2_plugins_sine_" ;
	rdfs:seeAlso <sine.ttl> .

# Explanation
#
# In short, this declares that the resource with URI
# "http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp") is an LV2 plugin, with executable code in
# the file "amp.so" and a full description in "amp.ttl".  These paths are
# relative to the bundle directory.
#
# There are 3 statements in this description:
#
# # | Subject                             | Predicate    | Object
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1 | <http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp>  | a            | lv2:Plugin
# 2 | <http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp>  | lv2:binary   | <amp.so>
# 3 | <http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp>  | rdfs:seeAlso | <amp.ttl>
#
# The semicolon is used to continue the previous subject, an equivalent
# but more verbose syntax for the same data is:
#
# <http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp> a lv2:Plugin .
# <http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp> lv2:binary <amp.so> ;
# <http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp> rdfs:seeAlso <amp.ttl> .
#
# Note that the documentation for a URI can often be found by visiting that URI
# in a web browser, e.g. the documentation for lv2:binary can be found at
# <http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#binary>.  If you encounter a predicate in some
# data which you do not understand, try this first.
#
# Note the URI of a plugin does NOT need to be an actual web address, it's just
# a global identifier.  It is, however, a good idea to use an actual web
# address if possible, since it can be used to easily access documentation,
# downloads, etc.  Note there are compatibility rules for when the URI of a
# plugin must be changed, see the LV2 specification[4] for details.
#
# A detailed explanation of each statement follows.
#
# 1: <http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp> a lv2:Plugin
#
#    The "a" is a Turtle shortcut for rdf:type and more or less means "is a".
#    lv2:Plugin expands to <http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#Plugin> (using the
#    "lv2:" prefix above) and is the established URI for the type "LV2 Plugin".
#    This statement literally means "this resource is an LV2 plugin".
#
# 2: <http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp> lv2:binary <amp.so>
#
#    This says "this plugin has executable code ("binary") in the file
#    named "amp.so", which is located in this bundle.  The LV2 specification
#    defines that all relative URIs in manifest files are relative to the bundle
#    directory, so this refers to the file amp.so in the same directory as this
#    manifest.ttl file.
#
# 3: <http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp> rdfs:seeAlso <amp.ttl>
#
#    This says "there is more information about this plugin located in the file
#    "amp.ttl".  The host will look at all such files when it needs to actually
# use or investigate the plugin.
