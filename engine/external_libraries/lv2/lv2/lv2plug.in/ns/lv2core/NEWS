lv2core (8.0) stable;

  * Merge with unified LV2 package.
  * Add metadata concept of a designation, a channel or parameter description which
    can be assigned to ports for more intelligent use by hosts.
  * Add lv2:CVPort.
  * Fix LV2_SYMBOL_EXPORT and lv2_descriptor prototype for Windows.
  * Remove lv2:Resource, which turned out to be meaningless.
  * Add new discovery API which allows libraries to read bundle files during
    discovery, makes library construction/destruction explicit, and adds
    extensibility to prevent future breakage.
  * Relax the range of lv2:index so it can be used for things other than ports.

lv2core (6.0) stable;

  * Remove lv2config in favour of the simple convention that specifications install
    headers to standard URI-based paths.
  * Add lv2:extensionData and lv2:ExtensionData for plugins to indicate that they
    support some URI for extension_data().
  * Make lv2core.ttl a valid OWL 2 DL ontology.
  * Switch to the ISC license, a simple BSD-style license (with permission of all
    contributors to lv2.h and its ancestor, ladspa.h).
  * Rename core.lv2 and lv2.ttl to lv2core.lv2 and lv2core.ttl to adhere to modern
    conventions.
  * Improve documentation.
